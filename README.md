This project implements a comprehensive quality inspection system for ceramic tiles using MATLAB. The system includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that employs various image processing filters such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, inversion, and bounding region analysis to detect and highlight defects on ceramic tile images.

## Overview
The inspection system is designed to execute the following sequence of image processing steps:

- Grayscale Conversion: Conversion of the input image to grayscale to simplify subsequent processing stages.
- Thresholding: Application of thresholding techniques to segment the image and identify potential areas of interest.
- Inversion: Inverting the image to enhance the visibility of defects and facilitate clearer detection.
- Bounding Region Analysis: Employing bounding region analysis to precisely locate and highlight defects on the ceramic tile image.
## Features
GUI Interface: An intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the system.
Image Processing Filters: Incorporation of filters like grayscale, thresholding, and inversion to enhance defect identification.
Defect Highlighting: Accurate detection and highlighting of defects using bounding region analysis for easy identification and analysis.
